# Flask-MongoDB Web App
## A To-Do List App

## Description
It's a simple to-do list application built with Flask and PyMongo.
There is a home page to show all important tasks and a a navigation bar.
A task page to show all the tasks and edit the tasks.
And a create page for users to create new tasks.
### Features
- **Create Tasks**: Users can create new tasks with a name, description, and priority level. The user can select or enter a priority level, and tasks with a priority of 5 are automatically categorized as important tasks and displayed on the home page.
- **Read Tasks**: Displays a list of all tasks with information about their creation date, priority, and topping status.
- **Update Tasks**: Users can edit existing tasks to change their name, description, priority, or topping status.
- **Delete Tasks**: Allows users to delete tasks from the list.
- **Topping Feature**: Manually top tasks for easy prioritization. Users can manually top tasks by clicking the "top" button, and these tasks will also be categorized as important regardless of their priority level.
